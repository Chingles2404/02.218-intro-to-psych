    text: "Mr Bean, the soya bean F&B company, started off as co-founder Loh Jwee Poh’s sideline career when the then 35-year-old partnered former classmate Kang Puay Seng to open the first stall at People’s Park Food Centre in Chinatown to test out their idea. Loh and Kang saw opportunities in making fresh soya milk and bean curd available past noon, when most stalls then were getting their supply from factories and selling only in the morning. \n\n3 years later, Mr Bean was furnished an opportunity amid the Asian financial crisis in 1997 to set up its first store in a mall. Initially, landlords were skeptical about a soya bean food vendor being able to afford rental in a mall and customers’ acceptance of the humble offering in a more upmarket location. \n\nToday, consumers can find Mr Bean outlets in educational institutions, train stations and hospitals. The company’s menu has expanded to a wide range of over 40 items including pancakes, rice bowls and ice cream, but most items use soya bean as an ingredient. Mr Bean, Loh noted, refreshes its menu regularly by replacing about 20 per cent with new items as well as serving up special products for various festivities.",

    text: "Unusual foods often gain cult followings. But it’s rare for an odorous dish to become a national favorite, which is exactly what’s happened with luosifen, also known as river snail rice noodles, now one of the hottest food trends in China. \n\nJust like the notorious durian fruit, this snail-based rice noodle soup dish has created a buzz on Chinese social media thanks to its infamous smell. While some claim the scent is mildly sour, others say it should be classed as a “bioweapon”. The noodle dish divides opinion sharply, with some families sending relatives eating it out on the street to avoid the stench; you either love it or hate it. \n\nLuosifen originated in Liuzhou, a city in China’s north-central Guangxi autonomous province. It features rice vermicelli soaked in a spicy broth, topped with locally grown ingredients including bamboo shoots, string beans, turnips, peanuts and tofu skin. Despite having the word “snail” in its Chinese name, actual river snails don’t commonly appear in the dish, but are used to flavor the broth. Infact, the infamous smell of the noodle comes from the fermented bamboo shoots and vegetables and not the river snails.",

    text: "Sheep farming is a demanding lifestyle. We will examine a traditional lowland farm in September, just before ewes (female sheep) go out with rams (male sheep) to breed the next year’s crop of lambs. \n\nFarmers first check their ewes’ conditions to ensure they are not underweight or overweight and are ready for mating. By pressing your hand over and around the backbone behind the ribs, you can rate the sheep on a scale of one to five, one being thinnest and five being fattest. At breeding time, ewes should ideally score 2.5-3.5. \n\nEwes that are too fat or thin are less likely to conceive and raise lambs successfully. Farmers split them into groups based on their scores and conditions, grazing each group on a particular pasture to adjust their weight. The thinnest ewes get the lushest grass, and the ones deemed overweight will get less luxury! \n\nRams are also quality-checked to ensure they are in good shape to be let out with the ewes. Farmers look for sound rams with good teeth, feet and firm testicles with a score of 3.5-4. Rams need slightly more fat than ewes ahead of mating – they have a lot of work to do!",

    text: "Spotted hyenas live in hierarchical social groups that consist of up to 130 members. In these ‘clans’ there is a strict hierarchy in which all females and their young dominate all immigrant males. Offspring inherit the social ranks right below that of their mother. Thus, spotted hyenas live in matrilineal societies led by an ‘alpha-female’ followed by her young and all other females with their young. Below the lowest-ranking native clan member comes the highest-ranking immigrant male, followed by all other immigrant males. \n\nDaughters usually remain in their birth clan for life and build close relationships with their mother and sisters. This system of coalitions reinforces the social rank of individuals within the clan hierarchy. Coalitions and clan hierarchies are therefore usually stable for many years. \n\nMost sons emigrate and join another clan at the age of about 3.5 years. When a male joins a new clan, he acquires the social rank at the very bottom of the hierarchy, irrespective of the social rank he occupied in his birth clan. In contrast to most other mammals, social relationships with other males rather than body size or fighting ability determine the social rank of males in spotted hyena society.",

    text: "Embodied carbon is the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission released during the lifecycle of building materials during extraction, manufacturing, transport, construction, and disposal. Concrete and steel contribute significantly to embodied carbon emissions. \n\nBecause embodied carbon accounts for 11% of global GHG emissions, it is imperative to prioritize this issue to meet climate goals. Reducing embodied carbon emissions is an effective and immediate way to take climate action, as the majority of emissions occur before a building’s construction phase. But how is embodied carbon calculated? \n\nTo quantify embodied carbon, practitioners use life cycle assessment (LCA) to track the GHG emissions produced over the full life cycle of a product, building, or infrastructure. These emissions are converted into metrics that reflect their potential effects on the environment. One of these metrics is global warming potential (GWP), quantified in kilograms of CO2 equivalent (kg CO2e). This quantity is also commonly referred to as a carbon footprint. \n\nArchitects can significantly reduce a building’s embodied carbon during the planning and designing phases. Embodied carbon calculators can be used to compare each material’s environmental impacts against alternative materials’. Under the guide of these embodied carbon calculators, building designs can strive for material efficiency, using low-carbon and carbon-storing alternatives.",

    text: "Crime has always been a point of fascination and fixation for humans, especially so in literature, be it Western detective stories or Chinese crime fiction. \n\nIn Western crime stories, ideal characters, while seemingly liberal and independent, are ironically conservative and elitist. Their Chinese counterparts are portrayed to be traditional and religious, yet have very democratic and liberal outlooks, even for today’s standards. \n\nWestern narrative structure portrays itself to be realistic but is in fact full of the exotic and the strange, often incorporating themes of self-exploration. In contrast, the Chinese narrative structure, despite its supernatural elements, is a vehicle for realistic social commentary and the appreciation of social harmony. \n\nTo understand the underlying difference between Western and Chinese detective stories, one must first examine the characters themselves, for they are the ones the authors breathe life and impart social and political meaning to. \n\nIn both cultural mediums, they each portray the ideal and undesirable versions of self, but that is where their similarities end. The Western ideal self, while celebrating the independent rational thinker and the break from absolute power, in fact hints at elitism. Whereas the traditional Chinese ideal self, while recognized as conservative actually seeks to reform rigid societal norms.",

Elden Ring? No, I haven’t even heard of that one,” said a depleted Trump, who merely added “absolutely, they’re all fantastic” when Musk asked him if he thought he would rather play as a spellcaster or bandit, and who then sighed and stared into the middle distance. “So you said Overwatch? And then both Diablo IV and Diablo II, but definitely not Diablo III? Wow. I’ve sure got my work cut out for me. Someone write that down, all right? And yeah, BioShock. I think we got it.” \n\nAt press time, Trump had responded to Musk’s offer to buy him his own Steam Deck by telling the billionaire that he had just remembered a very important meeting that he needed to take alone and quickly excused himself. The president-elect was heard muttering something about needing to “focus on more important things” as he hurriedly left the room.
